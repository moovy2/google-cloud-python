    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for GkeHub.

    The GKE Hub service handles the registration of many Kubernetes
    clusters to Google Cloud, and the management of multi-cluster
    features over those clusters.

    The GKE Hub service operates on the following resources:

    - [Membership][google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Membership]
    - [Feature][google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Feature]

    GKE Hub is currently available in the global region and all regions
    in https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones. Feature is
    only available in global region while membership is global region
    and all the regions.

    **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to
    use one of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where
    possible when working with Membership resources.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
